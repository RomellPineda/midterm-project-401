•	why did you organize your code/classes/methods/functionality in this way?
Because we wanted our code to be simple and easy to understand. Also we wanted to make sure all our team mates were able to collaborate the same amount of front end and back end.
•	how did you learn about this [library/method/design pattern/technique]?
AWS, Sergey did most of the research for AWS and implemented into our code. 
•	why did you name your variables/methods in this way? I would think of this as being named [other way].
We name our variables on our userController to be similar to our html templates to avoid errors, also to make sure the rest of the group was able to understand what the code was doing.
•	how did your team divide the work? which parts of the code are most familiar to you? (then, feel free to ask them lots of questions about the code that they worked on least–you should be able to explain every part of your app!)
We originally divide the code in four equal parts, back end only. 
•	which parts of your code feel hacky/buggy to you? can we try to work through those bugs now, live, together? (this will happen in almost every interview of this style!)
The CSS still need more work and need more resizing .
•	point out anywhere that’s missing comments, or where their explanation is particularly necessary to understand how the app works.
The post mapping generator it looks a bit confusing and probably because it is one of the longest method wrote for my team.
